# ProjectLizard Coding Standards

## Purpose

This document defines project-specific coding standards for contributors and AI agents.

## Scope

Apply these rules to:

1. New files.
2. New code added to existing files.
3. Modified sections in refactors.

When a file contains legacy style, prefer incremental migration in touched areas instead of broad formatting-only rewrites.

## 1) Interface and Class Organization

### Interface Colocation (Required)

- Define interface and implementation in the same file whenever the interface is primarily used by that implementation.
- Place the interface above the implementing class.

Pattern:

```csharp
public interface ITurnManager
{
    void StartPlayerTurn();
}

public class TurnManager : MonoBehaviour, ITurnManager
{
}
```

### One Primary Runtime Type Per File

- Keep each file focused on one primary runtime class.
- Supporting small enums or interface contracts may live in the same file when tightly related.

## 2) Naming Conventions

### Constants

- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for all const fields.
- Place constants in a `Constants` folder under the owning system root (for example `Assets/Cards/Constants/`, `Assets/DamageNumbers/Constants/`, `Assets/Editor/Constants/`).
- Avoid a single global constants root folder; keep constants close to the domain that owns them.
- Do not keep reusable constants inside gameplay classes like `EnemyBase` or `PlayerParty`; reference constants classes instead.
- Use `*Constants` naming for constants containers (for example `PositionConstants`, `DamageNumberConstants`).

Examples:

```csharp
private const float ROTATION_TWEEN_DURATION = 0.4f;
public const int START_CARDS_NUMBER = 5;
```

Placement example:

```csharp
namespace Assets.Cards.Constants
{
    public static class PositionConstants
    {
        public const float DISTANCE_ACCURACY = 0.01f;
    }
}
```

### Interfaces

- Prefix interface names with I.

Examples:

```csharp
IPlayerParty
ITargetsProvider
```

### Fields

- Private fields: \_camelCase.
- Serialized private fields: \_camelCase.
- Boolean fields: prefer \_isX, \_hasX style.

Examples:

```csharp
[SerializeField] private Camera _mainCamera;
private bool _isParalysed;
```

### Properties, Methods, Types, and Events

- Public properties and methods: PascalCase.
- Types (class, struct, enum): PascalCase.
- Events: OnX naming.

Examples:

```csharp
public int CurrentTurn { get; private set; }
public void StartEnemyTurn() { }
public event EventHandler OnEnemyTurnEnd;
```

## 3) Member Ordering in Classes

For MonoBehaviour and similar runtime classes, use this field ordering:

1. [Inject] private fields
2. [SerializeField] private fields
3. private non-serialized fields

Then keep methods in lifecycle and behavior order that reads clearly:

1. Unity lifecycle methods (Awake, OnEnable, Start, OnDisable)
2. Public API methods
3. Private helpers
4. Event handlers

## 4) Dependency and Architecture Rules

1. Use dependency injection through interfaces where DI is already established.
2. Do not reintroduce singleton access patterns where replaced by DI.
3. Keep dependencies explicit and narrow.
4. Reuse existing interfaces before adding new abstractions.

## 5) Unity and Inspector Conventions

1. Prefer [SerializeField] private fields instead of public mutable fields.
2. Keep inspector-facing names and tooltips clear when adding new designer-configurable values.
3. Preserve existing inspector workflows and serialized data compatibility.
4. For required `[SerializeField]` references, do not add defensive null checks in `Awake` just to throw custom errors. If a required reference is unassigned, rely on Unity's default missing-reference behavior; assigning required inspector references is user/setup responsibility.

## 6) Events and Turn-Flow Safety

1. Subscribe/unsubscribe in matching lifecycle methods.
2. Avoid side effects in event callbacks that break turn ordering.
3. For turn/combat logic changes, validate player/enemy turn transitions explicitly.

## 7) Logging and Comments

1. Use Debug.Log for meaningful runtime diagnostics only.
2. Remove temporary noisy logs before finalizing unless they are intentional diagnostics.
3. Add comments only for non-obvious intent or constraints.

## 8) Legacy Style Migration

If you touch code that does not follow standards:

1. Align changed lines with these rules.
2. Avoid large unrelated rewrites in the same change.
3. If a full cleanup is needed, do it as a dedicated follow-up change.

## 9) Current Known Legacy Exceptions

Some files currently contain non-standard constant naming (for example PascalCase const names).

- New code must use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- During edits, migrate nearby touched constants when safe.

## 10) AI Agent Execution Checklist

Before finalizing a change:

1. Interfaces colocated correctly where applicable.
2. Const naming uses UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
3. Field ordering follows Inject -> SerializeField -> private.
4. No singleton reintroduction.
5. Turn flow and shield-first behavior remain intact.
